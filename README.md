## 🚀 Welcome to the Most Unnecessary Port of DOOM Ever! 🚀

*"You know what? DOOM is great, but what if I could play it through SSH while pretending to work?"* 🤔

Well, congratulations! Your oddly specific dreams have come true! 🎉

### 🎮 What Is This Madness?

SSHDOOM is DOOM but rendered with **SIXELS** in your terminal! Because why use a perfectly good graphics card when you can make your terminal emulator cry tears of pixel art? 😭

Features that absolutely nobody asked for:
- 🖼️ **SIXEL graphics** - Like regular graphics, but more complicated!
- 📺 **Terminal rendering** - Say goodbye to your precious bandwidth!
- 🎯 **Perfect for SSH** - Don't leave your terminal! Frag demons from anywhere in the world!

### 🛠️ Building This Beautiful Disaster

Install libsixel using:
```
# mac
brew install libsixel

# linux
apt-get install libsixel-dev libsixel-bin
```

And then kick off the build using:

```bash
make

# Embrace the chaos
./doomsixel
```

Alternatively, you can just build using the Dockerfile

### 🎮 Controls That Totally Work*

*\*Results may vary. Side effects may include carpal tunnel and existential dread.*

| Key | What It Does | Actual Result |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| `w` | Move forward | Moves forward 🎯 |
| `s` | Move backward | Moves backward 🎯 |
| `a` | Strafe left | Strafes left 🎯 |
| `d` | Strafe right | Strafes right 🎯 |
| `↑` | Move forward | Actually works! 🙌 |
| `↓` | Move backward | Still works! 🙌 |
| `←` | Turn left | Turns left! 🔄 |
| `→` | Turn right | Turns right! 🔄 |
| `Space` | Use/Open doors | Opens doors like a gentleman 🚪 |
| `Enter` | Confirm/Fire | Pew pew! 🔫 |
| `ESC` | Menu/Pause | For when reality calls 📞 |

### 🎯 Pro Tips for Maximum Chaos

1. **Use a BIG terminal** - Like, REALLY big. Your DOOM pixels need room to breathe! 🫁
2. **SSH into somewhere exotic** - Why play DOOM locally when you can add 200ms of lag? 🌍
3. **Run it during a video call** - Assert dominance by fragging demons while discussing quarterly reports 📊
4. **Use tmux** - Because nothing says "professional" like DOOM in a terminal multiplexer 🖥️

TL;DR: It's free, it's open source, and if you make it even more ridiculous, you have to share your improvements with the world. Because misery loves company! 🤝💀
